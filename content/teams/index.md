Teams are the heart and soul of Crimson Kindness. Teams consist of fun activities
engaging you and others in acts of kindness. [Team Leaders](../team-leaders)
will provide an activity at each meeting helping you to spread a little more
kindness each time you go.

Teams meet every other week on Monday-Wednesday at 7:00 in the Ferguson Center on
the 2nd floor. You can pick the team that works best for you, but you
are welcome to participate each day you want!

*Please make sure that you [become a member](../join) before you become a part
of a team.*

**Member Facebook Group:** Once you’re a member, you can request to join the
[CK Member Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/crimsonkindnessmembers/)
